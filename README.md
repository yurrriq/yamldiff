A CLI tool to diff two YAML/JSON files.

Nothing fancy about the code, all the heavy liftin' is done by:

* [go-yaml](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/) - for YAML parsin'
* [godebug](https://github.com/kylelemons/godebug/) - for diffin'
* [aurora](https://github.com/logrusorgru/aurora) - for fancy printin'
* [go-isatty](https://github.com/mattn/go-isatty) - for tty detectin'
* [go-flags](https://github.com/jessevdk/go-flags) - for flaggin'
* [The Go stdlib](https://golang.org/pkg/) - for everythin'

Thanks to all the contributors of the above libraries.

## Installation

* Download a variant of `yamldiff-v$VERSION-{darwin,linux,windows}-amd64` from the [releases](https://github.com/yurrriq/yamldiff/releases) page.
* Rename the downloaded file to something sane like `yamldiff` :)
* Mark the file as an executable. On *nix, `chmod +x yamldiff`.
* Put it on your `$PATH`.

## Usage

`yamldiff /path/to/yamlfile1.yml /path/to/yamlfile2.yml`. The output is colorized by default. Colors
can be suppressed by the `--no-color` flag. Colors will automatically be suppressed if `stdout` is not a `tty`, for example
when piping/redirecting the output of `yamldiff`.

## Contributing

* Pull the code: `go get -u github.com/yurrriq/yamldiff`.
* Hack away!
* Send a pull request.
* Have fun.
